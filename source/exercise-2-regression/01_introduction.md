# Introduction

## Scope

The following educational material has been produced within the framework of the [2021 OSGeo UN Committee Educational Challenge entitled “Challenge 1: Training on Satellite Data Analysis and Machine Learning with QGIS (Satellite_QGIS)”](https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/2021-osgeo-un-committee-educational-challenge/?fbclid=IwAR0UvwkPO2pay7C0tJawb63eewjBGfeL9TIQpYUFccza9OIo6HAolmHXLWE). The main purpose is to demonstrate the new functionalities made available in the QGIS platform, extended by its plugins for processing satellite data with Google Earth Engine (GEE).

In this context, this tutorial proposes a methodology to get a trend of deforestation in the municipality São Félix do Xingu, located in Pará, Brazil. The GEE Timeseries Explorer plugin is employed to get acquainted with collections, filter date range and bands for historical data from one point (or a dot layer). Then, with the presented concepts, a python script will extend the analysis for a polygonal region of interest using the GEE resources to process and obtain a linear trend about the NDVI.

## Audience

This educational material is prepared for researchers, educators and professionals in local, regional, national or international agencies with an intermediate knowledge of geospatial information and usage of QGIS and basic Python (list, iterator, list comprehension and functions).
A deep knowledge about machine learning is not necessary, as basic explanations of the algorithms and supplementary information is provided.
Nonetheless, the tutorial is intended to be self-contained, meaning that anyone following the steps could understand and implement what had been achieved in this tutorial.

## License

The development of this educational material was coordinated by Patrick Happ under the mentorship of Maria A. Brovelli, Cristina Vrinceanu, Cung Thang and Zhongxin Chen.

This entitles that the users of this tutorial could share and adapt this content as long as the attribution is provided and that the same license is used upon adaptations. This tutorial has been kindly supported by the 2021 OSGeo UN Committee Educational Challenge.

## Software Used

All operations with raster layers were performed using [QGIS 3.16.10](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). The NDVI time series exploration of a point was using the [GEE Timeseries Explorer 1.1](https://geetimeseriesexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) plugin. The linear regression was generated by the [Google Earth Engine](https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/) plugin using python code.

## Acquired knowledge

After going through the entire educational material, each one will be able to:

- Monitoring of deforestation trends in a region of interest.
- Get into the use of PyQGIS to interact with the GEE plugin.
- Get into the use of GEE plugin with Python code to process algorithms.
- Explore historical data from GEE collections.
- Train a linear regression in order to obtain trends.

Notice that the main purpose of this educational material is to explain how to use QGIS and its interaction with Google Earth Engine for a real world application. There is not any rigorous concern about the obtained results.
