# Introduction

## Scope

The following educational material has been produced within the framework of the [2020 OSGeo UN Committee Educational Challenge entitled “Challenge 1: Training on Satellite Data Analysis and Machine Learning with QGIS (Satellite_QGIS)”](https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/2021-osgeo-un-committee-educational-challenge/?fbclid=IwAR0UvwkPO2pay7C0tJawb63eewjBGfeL9TIQpYUFccza9OIo6HAolmHXLWE). The main purpose is to demonstrate the new functionalities made available in the QGIS platform, extended by its plugins for processing satellite data.

In this context, this tutorial proposes a methodology for segmentation of snow areas in the Huascaran mountain, located in Peru, to monitor deglaciation. The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) and the Dzetsaka plugin are employed for this purpose, to download and pre-process satellite data, and to train a machine learning algorithm for classification.

## Audience

This educational material is prepared for researchers, educators and professionals in local, regional, national or international agencies with an intermediate knowledge of geospatial information and usage of QGIS. A deep knowledge about machine learning is not necessary, as basic explanations of the algorithms and supplementary information is provided. Nonetheless, the tutorial is intended to be self-contained, meaning that anyone following the steps could understand and implement what had been achieved in this tutorial.

## License

The development of this educational material was coordinated by Patrick Happ under the mentorship of Maria A. Brovelli, Cristina Vrinceanu, Cung Thang and Zhongxin Chen.

This entitles that the users of this tutorial could share and adapt this content as long as the attribution is provided and that the same license is used upon adaptations. This tutorial has been kindly supported by the 2021 OSGeo UN Committee Educational Challenge.

## Software Used

All operations with raster layers were performed using [QGIS 3.16.10](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). The acquisition, pre-processing, and clipping of Landsat 8 images was using the [Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) 7.9.7](https://fromgistors.blogspot.com/p/semi-automatic-classification-plugin.html) plugin. The classification maps using Random Forest were generated by the [dzetsaka 3.70](https://github.com/nkarasiak/dzetsaka) plugin.

## Acquired Knowledge

After going through the entire educational material, each one will be able to:

* Monitoring of natural environments using Change Detection.
* Download satellite data.
* Create a dataset for supervised pixel-wise classification.
* Train a machine learning algorithm for classification.
* Generate classification maps of a selected area based on predefined classes.
* Quantify changes between images acquired at different dates.

:::{important}
Notice that the main purpose of this education material is to explain how to use QGIS and its plugins for a real world application, in this case: segmentation of snow areas. There is not any concern about the obtained results.
